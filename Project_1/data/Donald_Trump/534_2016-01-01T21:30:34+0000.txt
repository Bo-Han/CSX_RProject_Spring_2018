"1" "2015 was a very special year, and I am grateful for your support! We are making history together! The silent majority is no longer silent - as seen right here!

All of us need to continue the momentum in 2016! If you ALL get out and VOTE - based on the poll numbers, and the sizes of our rallies - we can win! If we win, I assure you that I will be Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare! WE will ALL #MakeAmericaGreatAgain - TOGETHER! 

Thank you!"
