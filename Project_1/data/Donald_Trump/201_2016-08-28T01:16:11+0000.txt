I’ve met with many of these grieving families, including the incredible family of Sarah Root, a young Iowa girl who was killed by an illegal immigrant released from the border by the Obama Administration – and then released again after the killing.

I have been so inspired by the courage and bravery of all the families that have lost their loved ones - I will fight with them, and I will stand with them - - to END THIS CRAZINESS!"
