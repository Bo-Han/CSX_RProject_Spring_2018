It’s pretty simple to see why she isn’t 50 points ahead – she called millions of people deplorable, she's owned by Washington insiders, and she's lied over and over to the public and thinks it’s okay. It’s SAD! The American people want a leader who is working for them, not the rigged system. #AmericaFirst!"
