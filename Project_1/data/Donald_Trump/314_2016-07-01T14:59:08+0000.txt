WRONG: https://www.lyingcrookedhillary.com/lie/secret-server-hillary-broke-the-rules-lied-about-it

A report by the State Department’s own watchdog destroys Clinton’s lie that she followed the rules. She did not get permission from anyone to exclusively use private email for all of her government work; she failed the requirement to use an authorized and secure system for her email communications; she broke federal records laws by shielding her official records from congressional and public scrutiny; and, she ignored warning after warning that her setup posed a significant cybersecurity risk. 

There is no question that what she did was not allowed. The only question that remains is up to the FBI: was it criminal?"
