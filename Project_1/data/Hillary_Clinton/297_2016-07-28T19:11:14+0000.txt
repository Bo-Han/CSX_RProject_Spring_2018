I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. Because you’re who I was talking about twelve years ago, when I talked about hope—it’s been you who’ve fueled my dogged faith in our future, even when the odds were great; even when the road is long. Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope! America, you’ve vindicated that hope these past eight years.\" —President Obama"
