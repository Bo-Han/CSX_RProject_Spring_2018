"1" "In America, we don't all look the same, sound the same, or worship the same. But at our best, we pull together. We defend all our rights: voting rights, workers' rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and more. And if we have each other's backs and treat each other with kindness and respect instead of bigotry and fear, there's nothing we can't do together."
