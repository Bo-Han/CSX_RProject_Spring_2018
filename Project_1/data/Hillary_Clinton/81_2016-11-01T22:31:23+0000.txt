As president, I’ll fight to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to provide women the tools they need to fight wage discrimination. I’ll work to raise the minimum wage, because two-thirds of hourly wage workers are women, many of whom have to try to support their families on far too little. And I’ll promote pay transparency across our economy so that women have the information they need to negotiate fairly. This is a justice issue, an economic issue, and a family issue that needs to be addressed.\"  —Hillary Clinton on equal pay."
