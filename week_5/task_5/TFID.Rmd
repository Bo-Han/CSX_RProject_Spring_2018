## My Question: Using harrypoter to practice TFID
```{R}
# Import libraries
library(NLP)
library(readtext)
library(tm)
library(jiebaR)         # Chinese text segmentation, keyword extraction and speech tagging
library(jiebaRD)        # Chinese Text Segmentation Data for jiebaR Package.
library(tidyverse)      # opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
library(stringr)        # text cleaning and regular expression
library(harrypotter)     # provide full texts of the first seven Harry Potter books.
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
```
```{r}
# Text tidying!
# Tibbles are a modern take on data frames. Keep the features that have stood the test of time, and drop the features that used to be convenient but are now frustrating
text_data_frame <- tibble(chapter = seq_along(philosophers_stone),
                          text = philosophers_stone)              # smart way to take data frame(x and y)
text_data_frame
```
```{r}
# unnest these texts. Split A Column Into Tokens Using The Tokenizers Package
a <- text_data_frame %>% 
              unnest_tokens(word, text)
```
